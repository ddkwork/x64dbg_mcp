# Promotion Checklist - x64dbg MCP Server

Everything below is ready to copy-paste. Work through the list.

## v2.2.2 relaunch angle (lead with this)

The fresh hook for any new post/thread: **it works again on current x64dbg, and it stopped
timing out.** Two concrete, relatable fixes:

- **x32dbg loads again.** Newer x64dbg snapshots changed the loader to require an explicit
  `DllMain`; the 32-bit plugin would fail with `_DllMain@12 could not be located`. Fixed in
  v2.2.2 - 32-bit reversing is back.
- **No more spurious timeouts.** `run`, `continue`, and conditional traces are unbounded, so
  the server now waits indefinitely by default instead of killing long operations mid-flight.

Suggested one-liner to prepend to launch posts:
> "Just shipped v2.2.2 - fixed 32-bit support for the latest x64dbg update and killed the
> request timeouts. 23 mega-tools, AI-driven debugging, all local."

### r/ReverseEngineering

**Title**: I built an MCP server that lets AI control x64dbg - 23 mega-tools for AI-powered reverse engineering

**Body**:
```
I've been working on an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for x64dbg that gives AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf full control over the debugger.

**What it does**: 23 mega-tools across 21 categories - breakpoints, memory read/write, disassembly, tracing, anti-debug bypass, control flow graphs, IAT dumping, pattern scanning, and more. You talk to the AI in natural language and it operates x64dbg for you.

**How it works**: A C++ plugin runs inside x64dbg as a REST API on localhost. A TypeScript MCP server bridges that to any MCP-compatible AI client over stdio. All local, nothing leaves your machine.

**Example prompts**:
- "Set a breakpoint on CreateFileW, run, then show me the call stack"
- "Search for the byte pattern 48 8B ?? 48 85 C0 and disassemble whatever you find"
- "Hide the debugger from anti-debug checks and trace through the VM dispatcher"
- "Configure 8 logging breakpoints in one call that log function arguments"

**Install**: Copy the plugin DLL to x64dbg, add one JSON block to your AI client config pointing at `npx x64dbg-mcp-server`.

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/x64dbg-mcp-server

### r/ClaudeAI

**Title**: Built a 23-mega-tool MCP server for x64dbg - AI-powered binary debugging and reverse engineering

**Body**:
```
Made an MCP server that connects Claude (Code or Desktop) to the x64dbg debugger. 23 fully-typed mega-tools let Claude set breakpoints, read memory, disassemble functions, trace execution, bypass anti-debug, dump modules, and more.

Setup is just:
1. Copy plugin DLL to x64dbg
2. Add to your Claude config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x64dbg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "x64dbg-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}

Then you can say things like "disassemble the current function and explain what it does" or "set a conditional breakpoint that only triggers when EAX == 0" and Claude does it.

Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline.

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/x64dbg-mcp-server
```

### r/Malware

**Title**: MCP server for x64dbg - let AI assist your malware analysis (23 mega-tools)

**Body**:
```
Built an MCP server that bridges AI assistants to x64dbg. Useful for malware analysis workflows where you want AI to help navigate through packed/obfuscated code.

23 mega-tools including:
- Anti-debug: hide debugger, read/modify PEB, DEP status
- Tracing: conditional trace with logging, hit counting
- Memory: AOB pattern scan (returns all matches), read/write with verify
- Breakpoints: batch configure (set 8 logging BPs in one call), fast resume
- Analysis: xrefs, CFG, basic blocks, imports/exports, PE header parsing
- Dumping: module dump, IAT fix via Scylla, export patched files

Everything runs locally on 127.0.0.1. The C++ plugin sits inside x64dbg, the MCP server bridges it to Claude/Cursor/etc over stdio.

GitHub: https://github.com/bromoket/x64dbg_mcp
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/x64dbg-mcp-server

```

### r/cursor

**Title**: x64dbg MCP server - 23 mega-tools for Cursor

**Body**:
```
If anyone here does reverse engineering or binary debugging, I built an MCP server that connects Cursor to the x64dbg debugger.

23 mega-tools: breakpoints, memory, disassembly, tracing, anti-debug, pattern scanning, control flow graphs, etc.

Add to .cursor/mcp.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x64dbg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "x64dbg-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}

You also need the x64dbg plugin DLL from the releases page.

**Title**: Show HN: 23-mega-tool MCP server that lets AI control the x64dbg debugger

**URL**: https://github.com/bromoket/x64dbg_mcp

**Comment** (post as first comment on your own submission):
```
I built this because I wanted Claude to help me reverse engineer binaries without constantly copy-pasting between the AI and x64dbg.

It's two components:
- A C++ plugin that runs inside x64dbg as a REST API on localhost
- A TypeScript MCP server on npm that bridges to any MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

23 mega-tools covering: debug control, registers, memory, disassembly, breakpoints (including batch configure), symbols, stack, threads, modules, search (AOB pattern scan), command execution, analysis (xrefs, CFG), tracing, dumping (with Scylla IAT fix), anti-debug bypass, exceptions, process inspection, handles, control flow, and patching.

Everything is local - the plugin binds to 127.0.0.1 only, the MCP server uses stdio. No data leaves your machine.

Real use case: I used it to analyze a game's anti-cheat system. Claude traced through VMProtect'd code, identified FindWindowA-based scanner threads, decoded XOR-encrypted class names, and mapped out the detection logic - all through natural language commands.

Install: copy plugin DLL + add one JSON config block pointing at `npx x64dbg-mcp-server`.

I built an MCP server that gives AI full control over the x64dbg debugger.

23 mega-tools: breakpoints, memory, disassembly, tracing, anti-debug bypass, CFG, pattern scanning, IAT dumping...

Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline.

#ReverseEngineering #MCP #AI #x64dbg
```

**Post 2 - Use case thread**:
```
How I reversed an anti-cheat using AI + x64dbg:

1/ Claude set logging breakpoints on FindWindowA with fast resume
2/ Traced through VMProtect'd code at 46 hits/sec
3/ Identified XOR-encrypted window class names (0xF4AACCBC key)
4/ Mapped 5 scanner call sites + 2 scan threads (4s and 300ms intervals)

All through natural language. No manual scripting.

This is what 23 mega-tools looks like in practice.

4. Claude: "Search for the string 'license' in the main module"
5. Claude: "Disassemble that function and explain it"
